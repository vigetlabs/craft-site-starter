# Getting Started

This repo is a Composer "project" intended for use with the `composer create-project` command.

Our starter uses DDEV for local development. Install it before doing any of the following steps.

## Create Project

1. [Install DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/ddev-installation/)
2. Choose a folder for your project and move into it:
   ```shell
   cd /path/to/web/projects
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
   ```
3. Create The Project
   If you already have PHP and Composer running on your host machine (your computer, not Docker container or DDEV
   instance), you can run the following command

   ```shell
   composer create-project viget/craft-site-starter=^5.0.0 ./ --ignore-platform-reqs
   ```

   If you'd rather not set up PHP, you can create the project with a desposable Docker
   image ([Thanks nystudio107](https://nystudio107.com/blog/dock-life-using-docker-for-all-the-things)).

   ```shell
   docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/app -v ${COMPOSER_HOME:-$HOME/.composer}:/tmp composer create-project viget/craft-site-starter=^5.0.0 ./ --ignore-platform-reqs
   ```

4. Start DDEV & Install Craft
   ```shell
   ddev start
   ddev craft install
   ```
5. Run `ddev launch` to open the project in your browser

# Plugins

This starter includes common plugins that we use on most of our sites. This provides consistency and familiarly between
client projects. You may not need every plugin, but avoid
replacing standard plugins with similar alternatives (unless absolutely necessary).
